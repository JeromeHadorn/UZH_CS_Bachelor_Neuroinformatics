This repository is a summary of my Bachelor's degree at UZH. Listing all my visited courses, grades, displaying some interesting projects, and course work.

I'm pursuing a Computer Science Bachelor's it's split in a major and minor program.

**Major**
**Computer Science** with a focus on **Software Systems**. This program focuses on the question of how to develop software-based systems in a systematic, economically efficient way, as well as how to use them and keep them up to date. It looks at everything from small apps and web applications to data management systems and all the way through to super-scaled systems networked on many levels.

**Minor**
**Neuroinformatics** is offered as a minor to Bachelor students at the Institute of Neuroinformatics UZH & ETH. The mission of the Institute is to discover the key principles by which brains work and to implement these in artificial systems that interact intelligently with the real world.



**Current Weighted Grade** 5
