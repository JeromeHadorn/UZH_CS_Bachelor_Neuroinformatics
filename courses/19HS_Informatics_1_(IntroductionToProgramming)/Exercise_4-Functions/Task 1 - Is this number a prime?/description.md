# Is this number a prime?

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that can only be divided by itself and by 1. Write a function `is_prime` that takes an integer as an argument for which it checks whether it is prime.

Depending on the result, the function should return the strings `«x» is prime` (for prime numbers) or `«x» is not a prime number («a» * «b» = «x»)`, with the smallest possible `a` (for non-prime numbers). For example, calling `is_prime(12)` should return the string `12 is not a prime number (2 * 6 = 12)`. By definition, `1` is not a prime number, the function should return the string `1 is the multiplicative identity`.

**Note:** The provided script defines the signature of the functions. Do not change this signature or the automated grading will fail.
