# Calculating the price of ice cream

Assume that you are writing the cashier software for an ice cream shop.
The shop offers two types of ice cream, vanilla and chocolate, which will always be served in a cone.
To make your calculation logic extendable, all prices and the number of ordered scoops
can be configured through variables (i.e., `num_scoops_...` and `price_...`). Your task is it to calculate the total price of an order and store it in a variable called `price`.

Assume that the input variables are provided by the environment, you do not have to define them yourself.
