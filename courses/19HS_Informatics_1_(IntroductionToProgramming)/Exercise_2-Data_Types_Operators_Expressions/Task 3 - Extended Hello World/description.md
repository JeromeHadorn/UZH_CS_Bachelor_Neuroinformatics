# Extended Hello World

The first program a developer writes in a new language is typically a "hello world" program to
see a first output on the screen. In this task, you will create a more advanced version that can generate
a more complex greeting.

Given the two variables `name` and `age`, write a program that will generate a personalized greeting. For example,
for `"Hans"` and `37`, the program should generate the string `"Hello Hans, you are 37 years old!"` and store it in a
variable called `greeting`.

Assume that the input variables are provided by the environment, you do not have to define them yourself.
