# Arithmetic expression

Transform the following mathematical expression into a Python program to be able to calculate the
result for arbitrary values of a, b, c, and d:

`a - (b^2 / (c - d * (a + b)))`

Store the result in a variable called `res`.

Assume that the input variables are provided by the environment, you do not have to define them yourself.
