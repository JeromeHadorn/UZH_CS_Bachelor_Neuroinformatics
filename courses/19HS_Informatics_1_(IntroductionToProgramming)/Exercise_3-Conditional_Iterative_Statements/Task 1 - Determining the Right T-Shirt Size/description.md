# Determining the Right T-Shirt Size

The following table contains the sizes for T-shirts in the US market. The intervals are defined
in mathematical notation, for a precise definition of what chest size to include where.

| Chest (cm) | Size	|
|----------------|------|
| \[80, 90]		 | XS	|
| ]90, 98]		 | S 	|
| ]98, 104]		 | M 	|
| ]104, 111]	 | L 	|
| ]111, 124]	 | XL	|

Write a program that determines the right T-Shirt size for a given measurement of the chest circumference. The measurement in cm is provided in a `float` variable called `circumference`. Your task is it to determine the right size and store the result as a `string` in a variable called `size`.
For invalid sizes (i.e., measures outside the limits stated in the table), return
`"N/A"` as the `size`.

Assume that the input variable is provided by the environment, you do not have to define it yourself.
