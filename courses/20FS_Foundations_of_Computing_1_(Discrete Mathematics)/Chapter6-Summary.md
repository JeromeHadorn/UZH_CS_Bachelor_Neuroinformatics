## Operations on Sets

Let A and B be subsets of a universal set U .
1. The **union** of A and B,denoted A∪B,is the set of all elements that are in at least one of A or B.
2. The **intersection** of A and B, denoted A ∩ B, is the set of all elements that are common to both A and B.
3. The **difference** of B minus A (or relative complement of A in B), denoted B− A,is the set of all elements that are in B and not A.
4. The **complement** of A, denoted Ac, is the set of all elements in U that are not in A.
Symbolically: A ∪ B = {x ∈ U | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}, A ∩ B = {x ∈ U | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}, B − A = { x ∈ U | x ∈ B a n d x ∈/ A } ,
A c = { x ∈ U | x ∈/ A } .

## Power Set
Given a set A, the power set of A, denoted P ( A), is the set of all subsets of A.

 ## Some Subset relations
 1. Inclusion of Intersection: For all sets A and B,
 
* (a$)A∩B⊆A$ and ($b)A∩B⊆B.$

2. Inclusion in Union: For all sets A and B,
* $(a)A⊆A∪B$ and $(b)B⊆A∪B.$

3. Transitive Property of Subsets: For all sets A, B, and C, if $A ⊆ B$ and $B ⊆ C,$ then $A ⊆ C.$


## Set Identities
Let all sets referred to below be subsets of a universal set U . 
1. Commutative Laws: For all sets A and B,
$(a)A∪B=B∪A$ and $(b)A∩B=B∩A$.
2. Associative Laws: For all sets A, B, and C,
$(a)(A∪B)∪C=A∪(B∪C)$ and $(b) (A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C).$
3. Distributive Laws: For all sets, A, B, and C,
$(a) A∪(B∩C)=(A∪B)∩(A∪C)$ and
$(b) A∩(B∪C)=(A∩B)∪(A∩C).$
4. Identity Laws: For all sets A,
$(a) A∪∅= A$ and $(b) A∩U = A.$
5. Complement Laws:
$(a)A∪A^{c} =U$ and $(b)A∩A^{c} =∅.$
6. Double Complement Law: For all sets A, $(A^{c})^{c} = A.$
7. Idempotent Laws: For all sets A,
$(a)A∪A=A$ and $(b)A∩A=A.$
8. Universal Bound Laws: For all sets A,
(a) $A∪U =U$ and $(b) A∩∅=∅.$
9. De Morgan’s Laws: For all sets A and B,
$(a)(A∪B)^{c} = A^{c} ∩B^{c}$ and $(b)(A∩B)^{c} = A^{c} ∪ B^{c}$.
10. Absorption Laws: For all sets A and B,
$(a)A∪(A∩B)=A$ and $(b)A∩(A∪B)=A$.
11. Complements of U and ∅:
$(a)U^{c} =∅$ and $(b)∅^{c} =U$.
12. Set Difference Law: For all sets A and B,
$A−B=A∩B^{c}$

## Boolean Algebra
A Boolean algebra is a set B together with two operations, generally denoted + and ·, such that for all a and b in B both a + b and a · b are in B and the following properties hold:
