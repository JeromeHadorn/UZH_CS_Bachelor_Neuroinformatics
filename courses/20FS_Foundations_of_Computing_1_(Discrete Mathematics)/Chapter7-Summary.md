# Summary : Chapter 7 - Function
## One-to-One Functions
Let $F$ be a function from a set $X$ to a set $Y$. $F$ is one-to-one (or injective) if, and
only if, for all elements $x1$ and $x2$ in $X$,
if $F(x1)$ = $F(x2)$, then $x1 = x2$, or, equivalently, if $x1 != x2$, then $F(x1) !=  F(x2)$.
Symbolically,
$F:X→Y$is one-to-one $⇔$ $∀x1,x2∈X$,if $F(x1)=F(x2)$ then $x1=x2.$
## Onto Functions
Let $F$ be a function from a set $X$ to a set $Y$. $F$ is onto (or surjective) if, and only if, given any element $y$ in $Y$ , it is possible to find an element $x$ in $X$ with the property that $y = F(x).$
Symbolically:
$F:X→Y$ is on to $⇔ ∀y∈Y,∃x∈X$ such that $F(x)=y$.

## Bijection
A one-to-one correspondence (or bijection) from a set X to a set Y is a function
$F: X → Y$ that is both one-to-one and onto.

## Inverse Functions
$F^{−1}(y)=x ⇔ y=F(x).$

## Composition
Let $f : X → Y^{′}$ and $g: Y → Z $ be functions with the property that the range of $f$ is
a subset of the domain of $g$. Define a new function $g◦f: X → Z$ as follows: $(g◦f)(x)=g(f(x))$ for all $x∈X$,
where $g◦f$ is read “g circle f” and $g(f(x))$ is read “g of f of x.” The function $g◦f$ is called the composition of $f$ and $g$.

It turns out that the compositions of two one-to-one functions is always one-to-one.
## Cardinality
Let A and B be any sets. A has the same cardinality as B if, and only if, there is a one-to-one correspondence from A to B. In other words, A has the same cardinality as B if, and only if, there is a function f from A to B that is one-to-one and onto.

## Countable
A set is called countably infinite if, and only if, it has the same cardinality as the  set of positive integers Z . A set is called countable if, and only if, it is finite or countably infinite. A set that is not countable is called uncountable.
