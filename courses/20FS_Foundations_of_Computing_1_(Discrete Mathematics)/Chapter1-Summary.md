# Summary: Chapter 1 - Speaking Mathematically

**Universal Statement:**
Certain property true for all elements in a set.

**Existential Statement:**
There is at least one thing in the set for which the property is true.

**Conditional Statement:**
If one thing is true then some other thing also has to be true.

$Z$ - Set of all Intergers
$R$ - Set of all real Numbers
$Q$ - Set of all rational Numbers


## Set Builder Notation
$\{ x \in S | P(x)\}$
the set of all  such that P(x) is true

## Subset - Proper Subset
* $Subset -> \subset  (n(A) <= n(B))$
* $Proper Subset -> \subseteq (n(A) < n(B))$

## Relation
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Relation $R$ from $A$ and $B$ is a subset of $AxB$

* $A$ = Domain
* $B$ = Codomain

## Function
Special Relation:
* Left Total (every element in domain used)
* Right Unique (only one arrow starting per domain to an element in the codomain)
* Right Total (All elements in codomain used/accessed)
* Left Unique (Only one arrow max arriving at elements of the codomain)
