     "description": "Developments in technology have had a profound impact on people and the world in which we live, work, and interact. These developments are simultaneously enabling and challenging, and the co-evolution of computing and people's use of it has led to important issues for the design, development, adoption of technology, as well as the understanding of its impact on how we live.\r\nThis course provides an introduction to human-oriented aspects of computing, and serves as a foundation for further study in people- oriented computing. Fundamental human issues of technology will be covered at the level of individuals, groups, organizations, and society.\r\nThe course will provide a general introduction to key areas in people- oriented computing, and also touch upon relevant topics such as roles and potential careers in computing, methods and approaches employed in these areas, and future directions for technology.",
